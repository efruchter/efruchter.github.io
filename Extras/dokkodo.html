		<h3>Dokkodo</h3>
		<p<strong>Do nothing which is of no use.</strong></p>
		<p>Accept everything just the way it is.</p>
		<p>Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.</p>
		<p>Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.</p>
		<p>Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.</p>
		<p>Be detached from desire your whole life long.</p>
		<p>Do not regret what you have done.</p>
		<p>Never be jealous.</p>
		<p>Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.</p>
		<p>Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others.</p>
		<p>Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.</p>
		<p>In all things have no preferences.</p>
		<p>Be indifferent to where you live.</p>
		<p>Do not pursue the taste of good food.</p>
		<p>Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.</p>
		<p>Do not act following customary beliefs.</p>
		<p>Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.</p>
		<p>Do not fear death.</p>
		<p>Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.</p>
		<p>Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.</p>
		<p>You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour.</p>
		<p>Never stray from the Way.</p>
		<p><i>-Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, c. 1584 – June 13, 1645)</i></p>
